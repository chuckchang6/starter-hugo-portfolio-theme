The application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of image style transfer is gradually mature, which provides new possibilities for solving the heavy problem of Chinese font development. Through the training of a small number of font samples provided by the designer, the rest of the non-artificial fonts of the target font are generated, and the generated glyphs are similar to the designer font in structure and style. Then the generated glyphs are used as a design reference, which can improve the development efficiency of the font to a certain extent.

In this project, when using zi2zi and CycleGan methods, it was found that the edge generated by the font was easy to be blurred or even missing. Therefore, the new model added the edge as the input branch, and this branch would extract an information of the edge structure, and fuse this information with the features of the following font. Used to enhance edge-consistent freshness and smoothness of the output font.

At present, the representative company of Chinese font design industry, [foundertype(方正字库)](https://www.foundertype.com/index.php/News/newsdetails/id/24.html), usually designs 50 fonts containing 31 strokes of Chinese characters, and then designs 500 fonts containing most of the single characters and combined characters. Based on their experienced workflow, I was able to quickly create the font samples needed for training.

My goal this time will be to focus on training a high-quality font generation model with a sample size of 500 words. In the future, I plan to design a high-quality font generation model with a sample size of only 50 words.

This project selects two open source HYQiHei and SourceHanSerifSC as the source font and target style font, from which 500 fonts are selected as samples according to structural information and randomness. The final generation effect can be seen in the figure. The font edge contour generated by the new model is clearer, and the quality of style transfer is also better than zi2zi and CycleGan models in qualitative evaluation indicators.Four measurement methods are used in this project: SSIM (Structural Similarity index), FSIM (Feature-based similarity index), PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise ratio), RMSE (root mean square error)
