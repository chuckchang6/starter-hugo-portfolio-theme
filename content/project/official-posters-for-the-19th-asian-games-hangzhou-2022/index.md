The Hangzhou Asian Games were successfully held in October 2023 after being postponed for a year due to the pandemic

It adopts the timeless pixel style to directly convey the core information of the Hangzhou Asian Games. The poster combines pixel style to reflect the "smart technology" of the Hangzhou Asian Games, looking back to the past and looking forward to the future. The dynamic process of the whole poster reminds us of the pixel-based pictures of old computers and red and white game consoles, and we played pixel games together. The 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games, let's play together!

Query embedding should be different from documents embedding, which leads
us to the motivation of this project, as well as the representation of the results.
On the Quora question duplicated pairs test set, our positive-sample-only con-
trastive learning method demonstrates its superiority and robustness, which can
reach competitive performance to pseudo supervised learning. However, when
aligned with documents embedding, the performance is not satisfied and robust
as it on the query pair test. What indicates here is that our query encoder is
so good at learning query embedding that it is too domain specific to be har-
moniously projected into the document representation space. Here we suggest
that carefully think and develop the use of bi-encoder structure system whether
in NLP or other fields, since reaching expectation respectively does not mean
they could work well as a unity.

Having a much smaller query encoder that can be tuned with unsupervised
learning can be a great advantage to user privacy. We can deploy the small
model on the user devices and update parameters with Federated Learning, 
which is a distributed machine learning paradigm that mathematically ensures user privacy.
