zi2zi(字到字, meaning from character to character) is an application and extension of the recent popular [pix2pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) model to Chinese characters. It can tackling the same problem of style transfer between Chinese fonts.This is the first open source model I came across for style transfer between fonts. With the contribution of author Yuchen Tian, I tried to run it on my own machine and train it on my own dataset.

It adopts the timeless pixel style to directly convey the core information of the Hangzhou Asian Games. The poster combines pixel style to reflect the "smart technology" of the Hangzhou Asian Games, looking back to the past and looking forward to the future. The dynamic process of the whole poster reminds us of the pixel-based pictures of old computers and red and white game consoles, and we played pixel games together. The 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games, let's play together!
