The utility model provides a honey container, including a prismidal tank, which is divided into a first holding cavity and a second holding cavity by setting a partition plate, and sealed by the first cap and the second cap. By setting the first holding cavity and the second holding cavity, the utility model can be used for quantitative storage of different/the same kinds of honey, so as to realize the sub-packing and preservation of honey. Easy to carry out and quantitative access to meet the different needs of people.

At the same time, the design of the prismatic tank makes the placement of honey containers more stable, not rolling at will, to avoid the accidental sliding of the circular honey container in the life scene, and the honey containers of the prismatic tank can make use of each other's space and nest each other when stacked on the desktop, saving storage space.
