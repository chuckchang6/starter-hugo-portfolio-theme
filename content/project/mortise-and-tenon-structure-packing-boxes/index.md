With "Soma Cube" as the large frame, it is formed by the mortise and tenon combination packaging composed of four "L" shaped boxes, one "T" shaped box, "Z" shaped box and "V" shaped box. It carries out the idea of "mortise in mortise, mortise in mortise", that is, each box type is composed of two parts of mortise and tenon respectively, and seven box types can also be combined into a complete cube. This structure perfectly solves the problems of less mortise and tenon styles and difficult transportation.

The structure of the package also has a certain combination of fun. Because it is designed to pack snacks and has certain brand potential, we try to create a SNACK brand "MIX SNACK" based on its structure to convey the diversity of its combinations.
