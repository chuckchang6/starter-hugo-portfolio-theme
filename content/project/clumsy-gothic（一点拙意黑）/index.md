When I practiced writing and painting as a child, I was always slightly awkward on paper and in front of the computer, and this awkward feeling will gradually weaken in continuous training. This font tries to integrate some "awkward feeling" in the black body, add some extension at the end of some strokes, and the shape is slightly impressive, while maintaining the overall balance and recognition of the font. The overall font temperament has a little "stupid" and "clumsy", but not too much exaggeration, so it is named "Clumsy Gothic", and the Angle of tilt to the right makes the writing sense of the font stronger, and the sense of correct rigor is weakened, which is suitable for market signs or rural road signs.
