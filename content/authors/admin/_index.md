I am a master student from [Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts](https://www.gzarts.edu.cn/). My research interests lays in AI-assisted design, Generative art and design, Font generation. Recently I have been studying how to transfer different language font styles and even graphic styles to Chinese fonts. The ultimate question I'm thinking about now is whether we can develop easy AI tools to help designers creat more new styles of Chinese fonts.

In code learning and design practice, I came into contact with Adain, various forms of Gan and the emerging Diffusion model. The charm and potential of their style transfer led me to the direction of expanding discipline research.
